Todo:
- Make the git status work in Tmux (Added the scripts to install the go compiler but gitmux is not present as a binary to execute)

Notes after first try of the script (8/10/2024):
- QEMU installation went well (Yet to restart to verify) - It works!
- Only Office didn't install but it did uninstall any sort of libreoffice - Added in the script to install it via the Software Manager
- IMPORTANT: Tmux doesn't seem to be loading the plugins, for yank and git mainly.

Done tasks:
- Install Redshift
- Unable to copy/yank in tmux (xclip already installed)
- Unable to move within the windows in Tmux (Only to the right? but not left)
- Add the sudo nala install nvim to the script - The issue is with homebrew not working
    - Homebrew must work as even nala installs 0.95 which is not the current stable version
- Add the Nerd Font to the script
